# RecreatingSpotifyWrapped
Used flask for GET/POST requests, pandas/numpy for scientific computations such as aggregations, sci-kit learn for the machine learning aspect, SQL for querying the data, and matplotlib for data visualizations. Worked both with front-end(HTML) and back-end. 

There are 4 main components to this web app:
  1) Reports some basic statistics about my streaming history such as the total number of minutes of music streamed from 11-2020 to 11-2021 and the most  frequent song streamed. 
  2) Asks the user if they'd like to visualize the number of minutes streamed of songs by the top 10 artists or the number of minutes streamed of the top 10 songs. Shows the visualization on another page. 
  3) Asks the user to input any number of minutess streamed of songs by a potential artist and then predicts whether the artist is not popular, average, or popular in my streaming pattern (using KNN). Shows the prediction on another page. 
  4) Asks the user to input a month between 11-2020 to 11-2021 and then reports statistics like the minimum number of minutes streamed per song in that month, maximum number of minutes streamed per song in that month, average number of minutes streamed per song in that month, and the total number of minutes streamed of all songs in that month. Shows the statistics on another page.
